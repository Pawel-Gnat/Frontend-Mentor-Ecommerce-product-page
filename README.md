## My process

Not too much to say here about. I started with mobile view, coded my cart functions and carousel, then I switched to desktop view and finished necessary media queries and a modal.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

It took me 26 hours to complete this task. I didn't code that modal as in design sheet. I found it redundant and unnecessary, because I've got a carousel in my mobile view.
